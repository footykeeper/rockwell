Made to rank player's performance based on various stats. Points were derived from [here](https://www.playtogga.com/scoring).

Use the tracker [here](https://footykeeper.github.io/rockwell/tracker/), or see a brief tutorial on importing a roster [here](https://footykeeper.github.io/rockwell/media/tutorials/footykeeper-basic-tutorial.webm).

### Getting Started
No sign-ups are required to get going, and the software is free (for now).

To get started, go to the [roster creator](https://footykeeper.github.io/rockwell/rosters/) to create the JSON string used for roster saving. From there, it is recommended that you save the string somewhere easy to access, such as a txt file or similar format.

### Basic Usage

After getting your string, head over to the actual [tracker](https://footykeeper.github.io/rockwell/tracker/), and plug in your roster string. From there, **assign every player a position**. This step is crucial. Without assigning positions, the player recevies the events you assign, but no points, which messes up the rating system.

While recording stats at any time, click *view detailed stats* to see a table containing every player's detailed stats, included specific events. Also, press *print* to view a printer-friendly version.
